<p>To be able to use external applications (_GitHub Apps_) on a lesson repository in the Incubator,
the application needs to be approved by The Carpentries as owners of the carpentries-incubator organisation. We aim to be permissive and enable apps on request, but the Curriculum Team may refuse the request e.g.in cases where we are concerned that use of the application could:</p>
<ul>
<li>incur costs for The Carpentries</li>
<li>contradict <a href="https://carpentries.org/values/">our Core Values</a></li>
<li>require commitment of Core Team time for continued support</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to enable an application for use on your repository, please submit the request through GitHub by following the installation instructions provided by the application developers, and [send an email to the Curriculum Team](curriculum@carpentries.org) to let us know:</p>

<ol>
<li>what you plan to use the application for</li>
<li>which repository/repositories you want to use it on</li>
</ol>
<p>The Curriculum Team will review requests periodically and reach out to requesters for more information if needed. We reserve the right to suspend or disable an application at any time.</p>
